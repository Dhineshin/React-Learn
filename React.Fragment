React expects functional components to return as single unit. This creates pyramid <div> tags incase of nested components.

To flatten it use <React.Fragment> </React.Fragment> or to use it simple <> </>

<>
  <h1> hello </h1>
  <ChildComponent />
</>

Warning: When you use React.Fragment it deflattens all Div's as one single <Div> </Div>. This may cause bigger issues in CSS styling
if childcomponent and grandchildcomponent needs to have different styles.
